# URF-DSS
Hydrological Decision Support System for the Upper Roaring Fork watershed

[MODSIM](http://modsim.engr.colostate.edu) model for daily simulation of streamflows in the Roaring Fork watershed above the confluence of the Roaring Fork River and Brush Creek. Simulations cover hydrological variability observed in the historical record between 1975 and 2013 and include several years of extreme drought and large floods. 

MODSIM .xy file naming convention indicates the modeling domain, the simulation scenario, and the model version: [Model-Domain]-[Simulation_Scenario]-[Version].xy

## Scenarios
DSS scenarios available for the upper Roaring Fork watershed include:

**Baseline**: Representative existing hydrological conditions as they are affected by current patterns of water use and administration of water rights under Colorado water law.

**Natural**: Hydrological conditions that would exist in the absence of water use and management.

##Version Notes:

**Version 2** (2018-02-01): Updated distribution of flows in the upper Roaring Fork Watershed to improve calibration fit against downstream USGS and CDWR streamflow gauges on the Roaring Fork mainstem.

**Version 1** (2017-11-15): Initial models developed for the Roaring Fork River Management Plan. These models were used to complete IHA analysis presented in the attached Version 1 model report.
